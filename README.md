# StoryBooks

This is an application where people can create public and private stories. It uses Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB along with Google Oauth for authentication. I created this while learning from a tutorial

## How to Start

Navigate to story-app and type the following in terminal / command window

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm run dev
```
